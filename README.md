Users will be able to add credit to their wallet, place orders and contact you in case they require assistance.

## Documentation

`greed` currently does not have a documentation page, but you can try to read the [paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f4MKVr0B7RSQfWTSa_6ZO0LM4nPpky_GX_qdls3EHtQ/edit?usp=sharing) (in Italian) I wrote for my final Scuola Superiore exam about it.
